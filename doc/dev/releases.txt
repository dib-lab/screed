Release Documentation
=====================


Introduction
============

This is the release documentation for releasing a new version of screed. This
document is meant for screed release managers. Michael R. Crusoe and C. Titus
Brown have released screed in the past. Jake Fenton is the first to release
screed using this checklist.

Getting Started
===============

 #. Start with a clean checkout:
    cd `mktemp -d`
    git clone git@github.com:ged-lab/screed.git
    cd screed

 #. Install/update versioneer::
        pip install versioneer
        versioneer-installer
    
    If there is a new version of versioneer::
        git diff
        ./setup.py
        git commit -m -a "new version of versioneer.py"
        # or
        git checkout -- versioneer.py screed/_version.py screed/__init.py
        MANIFEST.in

 #. Review the git logs since the previous release and that ChangeLog reflects
the major changes::
        git log --minimal --patch `git describe --tags --always --abbrev=0`..HEAD

 #. Review the issue list for any existing bugs that won't be fixed in the
release and ensure they're documented in ``doc/known-issues.txt``

 #. Verify that the build is clean: http://ci.ged.msu.edu/job/screed/

 #. Set the new version number and release candidate::
        new_version=1.1
        rc=rc3
    Tag the release candidate with the new version prefixed by the letter 'v'::
        git tag v${new_version}-${rc}
        git push --tags git@github.com:ged-lab/screed.git
 #. Test the release candidate::
        cd ..
        virtualenv testenv1
        virtualenv testenv2
        virtualenv testenv3
        virtualenv testenv4

        # first we test the tag
        cd testenv1
        source bin/activate
        pip install nose
        git clone --depth 1 --branch v${new_version}-${rc} https://github.com/ged-lab/screed.git
        cd screed
        make install
        nosetests screed --attr '!known_failing'
        make test
        python -c 'import screed; print screed.__version__' # double-check version number


        # Test via pip
        cd ../../testenv2
        source bin/activate
        pip install nose
        pip install -e git+https://github.com/ged-lab/screed.git@v${new_version}-${rc}#egg=screed
        cd src/screed
        make dist
        make install     
        nosetests screed --attr '!known_failing'
        python -c 'import screed; print screed.__version__'
        cp dist/screed*tar.gz ../../../testenv3

        # test if the dist made in testenv2 is complete enough to build another
        # functional dist

        cd ../../../testenv3
        source bin/activate
        pip install nose
        pip install screed*tar.gz
        nosetests screed --attr '!known_failing'
        pyton -c 'import screed; print screed.__version__'
        tar xzf screed*tar.gz
        cd screed*
        make dist
        make test

 #. Publish the new release on the testing PyPI server. You will need to
     change your PyPI credentials as documented here:
     https://wiki.python.org/moin/TestPyPI. You may need to re-register::

        python setup.py register --repository test

    Now, upload the new release::
        python setup.py sdist upload -r test
    
    Test the PyPI release in a new virtualenv::

        cd ../../testenv4
        source bin/activate
        pip install -U setuptools
        pip install nose
        pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi --pre --no-clean screed
        nosetests screed --attr '!known_failing'
        python -c 'import screed; print screed.__version__'
        cd build/screed
        ./setup.py nosetests
 #. Do any final testing (acceptance tests, etc.)
     Note that the acceptance tests for screed are to run the khmer automated
     tests with the new version of screed installed and then to run the khmer
     acceptance tests.
 
 #. Make sure any release notes are merged into doc/release-notes/.



Notes on this document
======================
This is the procedure for cutting a new release of screed. It has been adapted
from the release documentation for the khmer project, found at
http://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/v1.1/release.html.
